# Legal & Safety Notes (Finbot)

> This document is informational only and **not** legal advice. A qualified lawyer/compliance professional must review before any public distribution.

## Intended use

- `APP_USE_CASE=PERSONAL_EXPERIMENTAL` (default): learning, lab, backtesting, paper trading. Respect local laws.
- Public/commercial deployment requires independent regulatory analysis (e.g., SEBI IA registration or partnership with a registered entity). No license or compliance is implied by this codebase.

## Trading risk warning

- Finbot outputs are AI-generated and **not** investment advice.
- Trading equities/F&O can result in large losses, including beyond initial capital.
- Use PAPER mode first; enable LIVE only after risk reviews and controls are in place.
- Consult a SEBI-registered investment adviser or other qualified professional before acting on any output.

## Operational guardrails

- Environment flags:
  - `FINBOT_MODE`: `dev` | `paper` | `live` (live requires `FINBOT_LIVE_TRADING_CONFIRM=true`).
  - `TRADING_MODE`: `PAPER`/`LIVE`/`DEMO` (used by safety audit).
  - `APP_USE_CASE`: `PERSONAL_EXPERIMENTAL` by default.
- Before public distribution:
  - Legal/regulatory review (SEBI IA rules and related circulars).
  - Confirm risk controls and disclosures are visible in UI and API responses.
  - Use the safety audit script (`python scripts/safety_audit.py`) in CI/CD for PROD/LIVE gates.
